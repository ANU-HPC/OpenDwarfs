Bitonic Sort
============

Status: Alpha

Bitonic mergesort is a parallel algorithm for sorting. It is also
 used as a construction method for building a sorting network. The 
algorithm was devised by Ken Batcher. The resulting sorting networks
 consist of O(n log2(n)) comparators and have a delay of O(log2(n)), 
where n is the number items to be sorted
