OpenDwarfs
=============

OpenDwarfs projects aims to develop a benchmark suite consisting of different computation/communication idioms for state-of-art multicore and GPU systems using the OpenCL programming model. 

The computation/communication idioms are based on the 13 Berkeley Dwarfs: (http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Dwarf_Mine).

Benchmark status
----------------

Stable:
gem

Beta:
bfs
cfd
crc
fft
kmeans
lud
nw
spmv
srad
swat

Alpha:
astar
tdm

Requirements
------------

Packages and libraries needed to build and run the applications.

To build:

    opencl >= 1.0 (some apps require 1.1, but we do not yet guarantee support for 1.2 in all applications.)
    autoconf >= 2.63
    autoheader
    automake
    libtool
    gcc
    maker

To run:

    opencl libs

Building
--------

To build all of the included applications:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make

To build only the applications you select, call configure with the --with-apps
option:

    $ ../configure --with-apps=srad,gem,cfd

To see a full list of options and applications:

    $ ../configure --help

Running
-------

See the application-specific README file in each application's directory.
