SRAD
====

SRAD (Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion) is a diffusion method for
ultrasonic and radar imaging applications based on partial differential
equations (PDEs). It is used to remove locally correlated noise, known as
speckles, without destroying important image features. 

Running
-------

In srad.h, define either GPU or CPU computation.

Usage: ./srad 128 128 0 31 0 31 0.5 2

    128 //number of rows in the domain
    128 //number of cols in the domain
    0	//y1 position of the speckle
    31	//y2 position of the speckle
    0	//x1 position of the speckle
    31	//x2 position of the speckle
    0.5	//Lambda value
    2	//number of iterations

Note: Currently, the GPU implementation can only support x-, y-dimensions that can
      be divided by 16.
