Needleman-Wunsch
================

Needleman-Wunsch is a nonlinear global optimization method for DNA sequence
alignments. The potential pairs of sequences are organized in a 2D matrix. In
the first step, the algorithm fills the matrix from top left to bottom right,
step-by-step. The optimum alignment is the pathway through the array with
maximum score, where the score is the value of the maximum weighted path ending
at that cell. Thus, the value of each data element depends on the values of its
northwest-, north- and west-adjacent elements. In the second step, the maximum
path is traced backward to deduce the optimal alignment.

Note: This application was ported from the Rodinia Suite
      (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/).

Running
-------

Usage: needle <length of sequences> <penalty value>  

Example: needle 2048 10

Note: This program generate two sequences randomly. Please specify your own
      sequences for different uses. At the current stage, the program only
      supports two sequences with the same lengh, which can be divided by 16.
