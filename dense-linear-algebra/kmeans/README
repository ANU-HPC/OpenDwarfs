kmeans

Status: ALPHA

Synopsis: In k-means, a data object is comprised of several values, called
features. By dividing a cluster of data objects into K sub-clusters, k-means
represents all the data objects by the mean values or centroids of their
respective sub-clusters. The initial cluster center for each sub-cluster is
randomly chosen or derived from some heuristic. In each iteration, the algorithm
associates each data object with its nearest center, based on some chosen
distance metric. The new centroids are calculated by taking the mean of all the
data objects within each sub-cluster respectively. The algorithm iterates until
no data objects move from one sub-cluster to another. 

Options: kmeans [options] -i <filename>

    -i filename      :file containing data to be clustered
    -m max_nclusters :maximum number of clusters allowed    [default=5]
    -n min_nclusters :minimum number of clusters allowed    [default=5]
    -t threshold     :threshold value                       [default=0.001]
    -l nloops        :iteration for each number of clusters [default=1]
    -b               :input file is in binary format
    -r               :calculate RMSE                        [default=off]
    -o               :output cluster center coordinates     [default=off]

Example: kmeans -o -i test/dense-linear-algebra/kmeans/100
