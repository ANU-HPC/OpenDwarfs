Try "Example commands"

Make sure they run from root directory / directory benchmark is in
	-Don't care, just standardize

Towards a 1.0:
Tweaked Documentation
Automated Testing
	-Might require changes to common header 
	-Standardizing timing, etc.
Initialization Stuff
	-Some benchmarks can't run on cards below a certain size
	-Let Init system bail and emit a meanâ€Œingful error if conditions aren't met
	-(Maybe after 1.0) Command Line parsing?
		-Device selection
		

THIS WEEK!
Test examples / fix
Look at how timing is done
How does centralized stuff work?
Input on timing facility to use (right now gettimeofday)
	-Maybe OpenCL timers?
	-How feasible is this?
