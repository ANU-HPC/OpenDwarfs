Fast Fourier Transform
======================

Status: Stable

Performs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function on a sine wave data set of variable length N.

Note: This application was orgininally developed by Eric Bainville as part of
his web blogs 
      (http://www.bealto.com/gpu-fft_benchmarks-1.html).

Running
-------

openclfft performs a one dimensional fast fourier transform over a given signal length N.
Usage:
        ./openclfft -p [platform id] -d [device id] -t [type id] -- [N]
        where: [platform id] is the integer id for the OpenCL platform to use,
               [device id] is the integer id for the OpenCL device,
               [type id] is the integer id for the OpenCL platform to use, by default this determines type automatically according to the selected device characteristics,
               [N] is an integer (and must be a power of 2) an indicates the length of signal on which to perform the FFT.
Additionally -d or --default, runs the default (original Gflops benchmark)
Example:
        ./openclfft -p 0 -d 0 -t 0 -- 128
