Compressed Sparse Row
===================

Compressed Sparse Row, or CSR, is a format for storing sparse matrices by
storing only non-zero values and their positions.  CSR uses three different
arrays to accomplish this.  The first stores only the non-zero values from the
matrix, from left to right then top to bottom.  The second array hold holds
the column position for each value in the first array.  The third array array
holds the locations within the first array that correspond to the start of a
new row.  CSR allows for a large amount of space saving, but using one in an
algorithm requires a step to process the data.

Running
-------

Usage: csr [vc]

    -v		     :Verbose output, prints output for every row
    -c		     :Use the CPU instead of the GPU

Example: csr -v
